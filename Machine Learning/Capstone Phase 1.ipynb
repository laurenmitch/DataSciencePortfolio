When I parked in front of Michaels I got a bit nervous not being in my own place or home. I hesitated to go inside.  I read our chats & the instructions he gave me m, to get into his place, were super easy AND it did not cause me to hyperventilate lol  Oh & also love that you have to take your shoes off, for i am the same way in my place 😍 The minute I walked in, i took a deep breath, I felt calm and felt as if I was at my own place. The energy in his home was very soothing and meditating. This is a place I’d come & stay all the time.! 😬 When I went towards his dining room table there was a note from him mentioning my name & telling me to “enjoy”. (Super sweet) There was a folder left on the table which had instructions for everything. Literally everything.  In their, he mentioned places to eat, one called Sequioa Diner, which I fell in love with. Reminded me of Nickel Diner here in DTLA that I truly love. My boyfriend said “Who is this guy?” Lol. He said, “I don’t know this guy Michael but I feel like he is a very awesome guy.”  I too felt a very majestic wondrous energy feeling being at your place .

There are a lot of stairs, which isn’t a problem for me because I walk a lot but it could be tough for those with arthritis or other conditions that make it difficult to walk   2. The roads in the neighborhood are narrow and windy, so I don’t recommend bringing a huge truck or SUV because parking is on the road   Bottom line, I would definitely stay here again!   \n","8241                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -getting in and out of the house at late hours wasn't a problem for us.  - washroom and room were clean. - laundry room were accessible everytime. - nice friendly dog.  - general communication with the host was very good and they were very welcoming.

I read our chats &amp; the instructions he gave me m, to get into his place, were super easy AND it did not cause me to hyperventilate lol  Oh &amp; also love that you have to take your shoes off, for i am the same way in my place 😍 The minute I walked in, i took a deep breath, I felt calm and felt as if I was at my own place. The energy in his home was very soothing and meditating. This is a place I’d come &amp; stay all the time.! 😬 When I went towards his dining room table there was a note from him mentioning my name &amp; telling me to “enjoy”. (Super sweet) There was a folder left on the table which had instructions for everything. Literally everything.  In their, he mentioned places to eat, one called Sequioa Diner, which I fell in love with. Reminded me of Nickel Diner here in DTLA that I truly love. My boyfriend said “Who is this guy?” Lol. He said, “I don’t know this guy Michael but I feel like he is a very awesome guy.”  I too felt a very majestic wondrous energy feeling being at your place .

The other guests are very nice. If you don't know people in the area, they will befriend you.   Kitchen is well stocked with cooking utensils and newly renovated. Bath room is good too. Room is nice and has a desk and closet.   Neighborhood is in the middle of Oakland. If you are bringing a car, note there is no designated street parking.  Short 12 minute walk to the BART. The walk can seem a little intimidating, but I'm a young female solo traveller and never had any actual issues.   Very good; would stay again!</td>\n","      <td>0.031</td>\n","      <td>0.110</td>\n","      <td>0.079</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-756358ad-a1cd-4254-97c2-2c76605f33c8')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-756358ad-a1cd-4254-97c2-2c76605f33c8 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
